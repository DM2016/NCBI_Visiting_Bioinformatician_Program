# NCBI Visiting Bioinformatician Program
Postdocs and Graduate Students Visit NCBI for 4 to 6 weeks for Training in Bioinformatics, Computational Biology, Data Science, Project Management and Product Management

## Project Highlights

```VBs will place links to their repos and other product deliverables here

Another Example:  Sean L https://github.com/ncbi-hackathons/snphancers (solo), https://github.com/NCBI-Hackathons/PSST (collab with Chipo M, Anmol V, Alex G, Devante T and others)```

## Training Objectives for the Visiting Bioinformatician Program

### Bioinformatics
  While most visitors are already bioinformaticians in some capacity, novel data types and datasets are explored, typically from public datasets.  
### Computational Biology
  Statistical methods and data visualization are also explored 
### Data Science
  Visitors typically work with streaming data, instead of localized datasets
### Project Management
  Typically, visitors are put in charge of a team of bioinformaticians during the last week of their stay at NCBI.  
### Product Management
  Visitors leverage their own use cases, the use cases of their colleagues, and reach out to others in government, academia and industry to find other suitable use cases for their bioinformatics products.  
### Communication
  For the most part, coding and research are done live -- primarily on github -- which is a distinct departure from antiquated scientific communication practices.
